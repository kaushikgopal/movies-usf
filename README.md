# Movie search using a unidirectional state flow pattern

This is an attempt at coming up with a unidirectional state flow pattern that uses the concepts
of patterns like Redux, Cycle.js, MVI etc.

Many of my contemporaries have already done amazing work in this area and I've drawn a lot of lessons and learnings from their work already:

* [The state of managing state with RxJava](https://jakewharton.com/the-state-of-managing-state-with-rxjava/) - [JakeWharton](https://twitter.com/JakeWharton)
* [MVI patterns with Hannes Dorfmann](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/episodes/103/) - [Hannes Dorfmann](https://twitter.com/sockeqwe)
* [LCE: Modeling Data Loading in RxJava](https://tech.instacart.com/lce-modeling-data-loading-in-rxjava-b798ac98d80) - [Laimonas](https://twitter.com/ThatLime)

I wanted to achieve the benefits of this pattern without necessarily introducing any new libraries
(aside from Rx). How would one familiar with an MVVM model today step to a world where all data flows in a single direction? I hope to demo those concepts with this app.


The app in itself is a simple movie searching app. Clicking the movie result populates a history list. While this is not an extremely complex app, it isn't a silly Hello World one either, so the hope is that it'll cover regular use cases for a basic application. 

I've also started meaninful test cases in the repo.


## Setting up your OMDB API KEY

_We use the wonderful [OMDB api](http://www.omdbapi.com) to fetch movie information._

There are quotas on this api, so please don't use mine :)

1. Get an [api key for OMDB here](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
2. Run this in a terminal like application

```
touch $HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties
echo "omdb_apikey=\"<API_KEY_GOES_HERE>\"" >> $HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties
```

You can read [this post for instructions](https://varunbarad.com/android/2018/02/01/hiding-api-keys-from-your-android-repository.html) on this private api
setting up process.

I gave a talk at [MBLT}Dev 2018](https://twitter.com/mbltdev) on how I went about building this app. [Slides can be found here](https://speakerdeck.com/kaushikgopal/unidirectional-state-flow-patterns-a-refactoring-story).

# iOS app

I gave another talk at [Mobilization IX](https://twitter.com/mobilizationpl/status/1184008559157219328?s=20) showing how we can use the same concepts on iOS too and wrote [my first iOS app to demonstrate these concepts - You can check that out here](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/movies-usf-ios).
